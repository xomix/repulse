=Tips and Tricks=

==Use the overdrive to get an analogue feeling==
In this case the _overdrive_ of the first voice is incremented and the _saturation_ is activated. The first voice contains a kick drum sound.<br>

==Create a velocity responsive sampler==
By incrementing all the _volume velocity_ modulations you can create a fully velocity responsive sampler. This is interesting if you want to edit the velocity in your sequencer, or use an external midi controller with pads.<br>

==Try different envelopes==
We have applied a _gate envelope_ (turns the envelope on after the note off event) to the ride cymbal (voice 2), with a short decay.<br>

==Join the voices 7 and 8==
Emulates the voice response of a old drum machine. Turning on the voice 7, turns off the voice 8, and viceversa. If you insert hi-hat like samples in the last two voices you can emulate a machine with one voice of polyphony for two samples.<br>

==Filter the metal section==
You can insert some filtering in the...<br>

==Tune the samples==
In this case we have tuned down the ride cymbal and the hi-hats by one octave, and tuned up the bass drum by one octave. This way new registers of the samples can be explored.<br>
