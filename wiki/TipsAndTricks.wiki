=Tips and Tricks=

==Use the overdrive to get an analogue feeling==
[http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/4528/overdrive.png]<br>
In this case the _overdrive_ of the first voice is incremented and the _saturation_ is activated. The first voice contains a bass drum sound.<br>

==Create a velocity responsive sampler==

By incrementing all the _volume velocity_ modulations you can create a fully velocity responsive sampler. This is interesting if you want to edit the velocity in your sequencer, or use an external midi controller with pads.<br>

==Try different envelopes==
[http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/5118/envelopez.png]<br>
We have applied a gate decay _envelope type_ (turns the envelope on after the note off event) to the ride cymbal (voice 2), with a short _decay_.<br>

==Join the voices 7 and 8==

Emulates the voice response of an old drum machine. Turning on the voice 7, turns off the voice 8, and viceversa. If you insert hi-hat like samples in the last two voices you can emulate a machine with one voice of polyphony for two samples. Having two samples _linked_ to one voice<br>

==Filter the metal section==
[http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/5984/filterh.png]<br>
You can make the metal section lighter or heavier by activating the _filter_ option and selecting a _low pass_, or any other, filter and adjusting the _frequency_ a bit.<br>

==Tune the samples==
[http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/8207/transpose.png]<br>
This time we have _transposed_ down the ride cymbal and the hi-hats by one octave, and _transposed_ up the bass drum by one octave. This way new registers of the samples can be explored.<br>

==Randomize some parameters==
[http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/7692/randomize.png]<br>
You can achieve a real analogue feeling by slightly coupling the note velocity and random source to multiple parameters, this way the machine never really does the same thing two times... As you can see we have slightly altered the random value on the voices 2, 7 and 8. In addition you have all the other parameters changed highlighted.<br>

==Reload the patch file==
You can edit the patch XML file and change any parameter while repulse is running. Change the _file_ attribute of the _Wave_ tag and press _CONTROL + U _, repulse will reload the XML file contents and update the wave files and any other parameter changed in the XML file; but more important you dont have to quit repulse losing all the connection work. You can edit the XML patch file to [EditingPatches rename, delete or shuffle] patches.

==Swap patches==
The first 128 patches found in the patch file are assignable via the standard midi [Controllers controller] program change.<br>Sometimes is convenient to shuffle the first 128 pressets around. You can do this by [EditingPatches editing the patch file].
