==What is repulse?==
Repulse is a MIDI Jack real time sampler machine that can be used to play drum kits or other sounds.<br>
It has 8 voices of polyphony and supports a rich set of parameters per voice.<br>
This are its key features:

 * 8 voice sampler.
 * Transpose any voice in real time.
 * Time stretch any voice in real time.
 * Different decay envelopes to choose from.
 * Five types of analogue filters to choose from.
 * An analogue overdrive filter per voice.
 * A rich set of parameter modulation capabilities.
 * Full MIDI compatibility.
 * And a lot of other [TipsAndTricks features]...

Using the parameter modulation capabilities you can slightly randomize, or velocity control, the key parameters.<br>
You can easily achieve a non-linear _analogue_ sound by tuning this parameters up and down slightly.<br>
If you drive the modulation parameters all the way up whacky effects can be achieved.

Repulse does not contain a sequencer, use any sequencer of your choice to control the sampler, try [http://www.filter24.org/seq24 Seq42] or [http://www.rosegardenmusic.com Rosegarden].

This is what repulse looks like, currently there is a curses GUI to drive the software (aside from MIDI control).<br><br>
