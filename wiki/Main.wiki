==What is repulse?==
Repulse is a MIDI Jack real time sampler machine that can be used to play drum kits or other sounds. It has 8 voices of polyphony and supports a rich set of parameters per voice. The key features:

 * You can transpose any voice in real time.
 * You can time stretch any voice in real time.
 * Different decay envelopes to choose from.
 * Five types of analogue filters to choose from.
 * An analogue overdrive filter per voice.
 * Full MIDI compatibility.

Repulse does not contain a sequencer, use any sequencer of your choice to control the sampler, try [http://www.filter24.org/seq24 Seq42] or [http://www.rosegardenmusic.com Rosegarden].

This is what repulse looks like. Currently there is a curses GUI to drive the software (Aside from midi control). Keep in mind that repulse is under heavy development and cant bite your dog. :)
