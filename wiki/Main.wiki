Welcome to the Repulse project page.

Repulse is a MIDI Jack real time sampler machine that can be used to play drum kits or other sounds. It has 8 voices of polyphony and supports a rich set of parameters per voice.

Repulse does not contain a sequencer, use any sequencer of your choice to control the sampler, try [http://www.filter24.org/seq24 Seq42] or [http://www.rosegardenmusic.com Rosegarden].

==Per voice controllers==
This are some of the parameters per voice:
 * Start time: delays the start time of the sound the given miliseconds.
 * Transpose: transpose the sound the given octaves.
 * Time Stretch: stretch the sound by the given percentage (the pitch does not change), you have different time stretch types to choose from.
 * Staturation: introduce analog like saturation into the sound.
 * Filtering: you have five types to choose from: low pass, high pass, band pass 1, band pass 2 and notch with controllable cutoff and resonance.
 * Envelope: you have three envelopes to choose from, with a tuneable decay time:
    * Infinite: does not apply any envelope.
    * Trigger: also known as one shot, starts the decay envelope on note on event.
    * Gate: starts the decay after the note off event.
 * Panning: pan the voice to the left or the right in the stereo output.
 * Volume: adjust the output volume of the voice.
