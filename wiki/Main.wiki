=Welcome to the repulse project=

==What is repulse?==
Repulse is a MIDI Jack real time sampler machine that can be used to play drum kits or other sounds. It has 8 voices of polyphony and supports a rich set of parameters per voice.

Repulse does not contain a sequencer, use any sequencer of your choice to control the sampler, try [http://www.filter24.org/seq24 Seq42] or [http://www.rosegardenmusic.com Rosegarden].

==Per voice controllers==
This are some of the parameters per voice:
 * _Start time:_ delays the start time of the sound the given miliseconds.
 * _Transpose:_ transpose the sound the given octaves.
 * _Time Stretch:_ stretch the sound by the given percentage (the pitch does not change), you have different time stretch types to choose from.
 * _Staturation:_ introduce analog like saturation into the sound.
 * _Filtering:_ you have five types to choose from with controllable cutoff and resonance:
  * low pass
  * high pass
  * band pass 1
  * band pass 2
  * notch
 * _Envelope:_ you have three envelopes to choose from, with a tuneable decay time:
    * Infinite: does not apply any envelope.
    * Trigger: also known as one shot, starts the decay envelope on note on event.
    * Gate: starts the decay after the note off event.
 * _Panning:_ pan the voice to the left or the right in the stereo output.
 * _Volume:_ adjusts the output volume of the voice.

==Controller Modulation==
Almost any parameter can be modulated jointly by note velocity and a random source.
 * Modulating by *note velocity* you can create a velocity reactive sampler, other parameters can be modulated by velocity to achieve subtle effects.
 * Modulating different parameters by the *random source*, with small values, induces an analogue feeling to the machine.

You can apply random modulation to all the parameters at the same time by a minuscule value to achieve an analogue effect. Or you can turn the random modulations up to get strange effects.<br>
The velocity modulation can applied to uncommon parameters at the same time, like the cutoff frequency, to get interesting sounds.

==MIDI Support==
You can drive any parameter that you can see in the GUI with a midi controller. You can check the [Controllers] page to see the detailed controller mappings.<br>
The MIDI support is quite good with repulse responding to the program change, all controllers/notes off, omni, poly, volume and plenty of other custom events.<br>
Currently the supported MIDI driver is ALSA, Jack will be added in the future.
