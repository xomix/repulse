Introduction
============

What is repulse?
----------------

Repulse is a MIDI Jack real time sampler machine that can be used to play 
drum kits or other sounds.
It has 8 voices of polyphony and supports a rich set of parameters per voice.
Repulse does not contain a sequencer, use any sequencer of your choice to 
control the sampler, try:

 o Seq24. http://www.filter24.org/seq24
 o Rosegarden. http://www.rosegardenmusic.com


Voice controllers
-----------------

This are some of the parameters per voice:

 o Start time: delays the start time of the sound the given miliseconds.
 o Transpose: transpose the sound the given octaves.
 o Time Stretch: stretch the sound by the given percentage 
   (the pitch does not change).
   You have different time stretch types to choose from.
 o Staturation: introduce analog like saturation into the sound.
 o Filtering: you have five types to choose from with controllable 
   cutoff and resonance:
  * Low pass.
  * High pass.
  * Band pass 1.
  * Band pass 2.
  * Notch
 o Envelope: you have three envelopes to choose from, with a tuneable 
   decay time:
  * Infinite: does not apply any envelope.
  * Trigger: also known as one shot, starts the decay envelope on 
    note on event.
  * Gate: starts the decay after the note off event.
 o Panning: pan the voice to the left or the right in the stereo output.
 o Volume: adjusts the output volume of the voice.


Controller modulation
---------------------

Almost any parameter can be modulated jointly by note velocity and a
random source:

 o Modulating by note velocity you can create a velocity reactive sampler.
   Other parameters can be modulated by velocity to achieve subtle effects.
 o Modulating different parameters by the random source, with small values,
   induces an analogue feeling to the machine.

You can apply random modulation to all the parameters at the same time 
by a minuscule value to achieve an analogue effect.
Or you can turn the random modulations up to get strange effects.
The velocity modulation can applied to uncommon parameters at the same time,
like the cutoff frequency, to get interesting sounds.


MIDI support
------------

You can drive any parameter that you can see in the GUI with a midi controller.
You can check the [Controllers] page to see the detailed controller mappings.
The MIDI support is quite good with repulse responding to the program change,
all controllers/notes off, omni, poly, volume and plenty of other custom events.
Currently the supported MIDI driver is ALSA, Jack will be added in the future.


Installing
==========

Dependencies
------------

 o ALSA. http://www.alsa-project.org
 o Jack. http://jackaudio.org
 o SndFile. http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile
 o Secret Rabbit (libsamplerate). http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC


Compiling
---------

After downloading you can compile a binary like this:

 $ cd repulse
 $ ./build.sh


Executing
---------

You can go on and execute repulse like this:

 $ ./repulse -c patch.xml

In general you can execute:

 $ repulse [-c] [-n jackclientname] <patch_file>

This are the repulse command line switches:

 o -c: autoconnect the repulse stereo output to the first physical output.
 o -n jack_client_name: the client name in the Jack environment.

By default the engine name is repulse and the machine does not autoconnect
its outputs.
So if you dont use the -c switch you have to manually connect the outputs.
Repulse searches for wave files relative to the binary location folder.


Downloading the SVN version
---------------------------

Use this command to anonymously check out the latest project source code:

 $ svn checkout http://repulse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ repulse


Curses GUI
==========

Keyboard controls
-----------------

 o Arrow keys: moves the cursor in the spread-sheet like grid.
 o A key: tune the selected cell parmeter up.
 o Z key: tune the selected cell parmeter down.
 o S key: tune the selected cell parmeter up, finer increment.
 o X key: tune the selected cell parmeter down, finer decrement.

     time stretch value.
   * When deactivated the pitch bend wheel controls the engine's 
     transpose value.
 o CONTROL + O: omni on/off toggle.
   * When activated the machine will receive MIDI events in any channel.
   * When deactivated the machine will receive MIDI events only the 
     base channel (10).
 o CONTROL + V: Mono on/off toggle.
   * When activated the machine operates in mono and does not mix-down 
     the stereo channel.
   * When deactivated the machine operates in mono and does the mix-down 
     of the stereo channel.
 o CONTROL + E: quits the software.
 o CONTROL + T: changes the MIDI base note, by default it is 60 (middle c).
 o CONTROL + J: changes the MIDI base channel, by default it is the channel 10.

MIDI controllers
================

Engine controllers
------------------

This are the controllers for the repulse engine, it listens to this 
controllers on the base channel 10 and 11
Only the engine controllers are listened on any channel (omni).

 o You can send a Program Change to select between the first 128 presets 
   in the machine.
 o Sliding the Pitch Wheel MIDI controller it is possible to apply a pitch 
   transposition to all the voices.
 o You can switch the Wheel toggle to make the Pitch Wheel control the 
   overall time-stretch.

Voice controllers
-----------------

Almost every parameter in the machine can be controlled via MIDI.
The number of controllers spans two midi channels, base channels 10 and 11.
In MIDI channel 10 you have the common controllers, in MIDI channel 11 you 
can find the modulation controllers.
The omni switch does not affect the voice controllers, you have to send them in 
their own channel (base channel 10 and 11).
The engine related controllers can received in omni (view the previous table).

 o The machine always receives voice controllers on channels 10 and 11. 
   The MIDI base channel can be changed via the GUI.
 o The machine receives note on message for the MIDI notes 60 to 67. 
   The MIDI base note can be changed via the GUI.

This is the full list of voice (and engine) controllers:

Editing patches
===============

Tip: you can reload the XML file by pressing CONTROL + U while repulse 
     is running.

Creating a patch File
---------------------

You can create a preset by saving a text file with this content:

 <Repulse>
    <Waves>
        <Wave file="909/BT7A0DA.WAV" />
        <Wave file="909/RIDED2.WAV" />
        <Wave file="909/ST7T7S7.WAV" />
        <Wave file="909/HANDCLP1.WAV" />
        <Wave file="909/RIM63.WAV" />
        <Wave file="909/LT0D0.WAV" />
        <Wave file="909/HHCDA.WAV" />
        <Wave file="909/HHODA.WAV" />
    </Waves>
 </Repulse>

And introducing a file value that corresponds to the location of your 
wave files.
The machine will look for wave files relative to the XML file directory, 
you can enter absolute paths too.

Deleting patches
----------------

You can delete a whole preset by removing its XML block:

 <Presets>
    <Preset name="Preset 1"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
    <Preset name="Preset 2"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
 </Presets>

Becomes:

 <Presets>
    <Preset name="Preset 1"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
 </Presets>


Renaming patches
----------------

You can rename a preset by changing its name attribute:

 <Preset name="Preset 1"><!-- other tags --></Preset>

Becomes:

 <Preset name="My Preset"><!-- other tags --></Preset>


Swapping patches
----------------

The first 128 patches found in the XML are assignable via the standard 
midi controller program change.
Sometimes is convenient to shuffle the first 128 pressets around.

You can do this by simply swapping the preset tags:

 <Presets>
    <Preset name="Preset 1"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
    <Preset name="Preset 2"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
    <Preset name="Preset 3"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
 </Presets>

Becomes:

 <Presets>
    <Preset name="Preset 2"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
    <Preset name="Preset 1"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
    <Preset name="Preset 3"><!-- other tags --></Preset>
 </Presets>


Tips and Tricks
===============

Use the overdrive to get an analogue feeling
--------------------------------------------

Drive        2.20      1.00      1.00      1.00      1.00      1.00      1.00      1.00
Sat           [o]       [ ]       [ ]       [ ]       [ ]       [ ]       [ ]       [ ]

In this case the overdrive of the first voice is incremented and the saturation 
is activated. The first voice contains a bass drum sound.


Create a velocity responsive sampler
------------------------------------

Velocity  100.00%   100.00%   100.00%   100.00%   100.00%   100.00%   100.00%   100.00%

By incrementing all the volume velocity modulations you can create a fully 
velocity responsive sampler. This is interesting if you want to edit 
the velocity 
in your sequencer, or use an external midi controller with pads.


Try different envelopes
-----------------------

Decay      2.00 s    0.40s    2.00 s    2.00 s    2.00 s    2.00 s    2.00 s     2.00 s
Type     infinite     gate  infinite  infinite  infinite  infinite  infinite   infinite

We have applied a gate decay envelope type (turns the envelope on after 
the note off event) 
to the ride cymbal (voice 2), with a short decay.


Join the voices 7 and 8
-----------------------

Linked                                                           [o]       [o]      [o]

Emulates the voice response of an old drum machine. Turning on the voice 7, 
turns off the voice 8, and viceversa. If you insert hi-hat like samples 
in the last two voices you can emulate a machine with one voice of polyphony 
for two samples. Having two samples linked to one voice


Filter the metal section
------------------------

You can make the metal section lighter or heavier by activating the filter 
option and selecting a low pass, or any other, filter and adjusting the 
frequency a bit.


Tune the samples
----------------

Transpose    1 st     -1 st      0 st      0 st      0 st      0 st     -1 st     -1 st

This time we have transposed down the ride cymbal and the hi-hats by one 
octave, and transposed up the bass drum by one octave. This way new 
registers of the samples can be explored.


Randomize some parameters
-------------------------

You can achieve a real analogue feeling by slightly coupling the note 
velocity and random source to multiple parameters, this way the machine 
never really does the same thing two times...
 
 o Change the Velocity and Random parameters for the Transpose section,
   set them to 0.20 % for the Voices 1, 7 and 8 (The ride cymnbal and 
   hi-hats). This way the pitch of this instruments is altered
   by a small factor by the key velocity and a random source.
 o Add a small random variation to the filter frequency of voices 7 
   and 8, set the Random value of the Filter section to 0.20%.
   This way the filter frequency will constantly change by a small 
   random factor.

Reload the patch file
---------------------
You can edit the patch XML file and change any parameter while repulse 
is running. 
Change the file attribute of the Wave tag and press CONTROL + U, repulse 
will reload the XML file contents and update the wave files and any other 
parameter changed in the XML file; but more important you dont have to 
quit repulse losing all the connection work. 
You can edit the XML patch file to rename, delete or shuffle patches.


Swap patches
------------
The first 128 patches found in the patch file are assignable via the 
standard midi controller program change.
Sometimes is convenient to shuffle the first 128 presets around. 
You can do this by editing the XML patch file.
